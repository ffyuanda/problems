# The Black_Hole class is derived from Simulton; for updating it finds+removes
#   objects (of any class derived from Prey) whose center is contained inside
#   its radius (returning a set of all eaten simultons), and displays as a
#   black circle with a radius of 10 (width/height 20).
# Calling get_dimension for the width/height (for containment and displaying)'
#   will facilitate inheritance in Pulsator and Hunter
