# Assignment #2: Chatting with Friends
#
# Author: Mark S. Baldwin
#
# v0.1.6
# Revisions:
#   v0.1.6 - fixed timestamp assignment
#   v0.1.5 - removed debug code
#   v0.1.4 - fixed typo in post reading loop in load_profile function
#   v0.1.3 - added properties for setting and getting timestamp attribute in Post object
#   v0.1.2 - changed load_profile to add posts directly to __posts list, rather than through add_posts.
#          - changed Post initialization behavior to fix timestamp overwriting on saving.
#   v0.1.1 - added property assignment for dsuserver during deserialization
#
# You should review this code to identify what features you need to support
# in your program for assignment 2. I could tell you what they are, but
# it is critical to becoming a good programmer that you are able to identify 
# the capabilities of external modules on your own. However, I recognize that
# this might seem like a lot. So will leave you with one clue: there are five points
# of data supported by the two classes in this module that you will need to collect
# through your program user interface.
#
# YOU DO NOT NEED TO READ OR UNDERSTAND THE JSON SERIALIZATION ASPECTS OF THIS CODE, 
# though can you certainly feel free to take a look at it.
